  # Code, and must not throw away logins it only ever borrowed.

  caveats <<~EOS
    The first launch asks for your keychain password: the app reads and writes
    Claude Code's keychain login. "Always Allow" answers it for good; it asks
    again after an update, because the signature changes with each build.

    This build is not notarised (no Apple Developer Program membership). The cask
    clears the download quarantine for you after installing, which is what a
    direct downloader does by hand with `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`.
